1. For Web Apps
    React --> ReactDOM

2. The `index.html` is the main page that loads, which is why they are single-page applications (SPA).
3. React creates its own DOM called the Virtual DOM. It then compares it with the main DOM and makes the necessary changes.
4. function name must be capitalize (in react). function is nothing but the component and file name can ends with `js` or `jsx`
5. In some libraries like `vite` there is a strict rule, file name ends with `.jsx` and file name can start with small letter.
6. In react, javascript is added in HTML file through react-scripts but it is not shown in the HTML file. It can be seen through Inspect window.
7. In vite , javascript is loaded in HTML file through the script tag.
